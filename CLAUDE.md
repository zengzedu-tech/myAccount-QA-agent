## Development Workflow

- Branch naming: feature branches should be descriptive
- Commit messages: use clear, concise descriptions of changes
- Push changes to the appropriate feature branch before merging

## Key Conventions

- Keep code clean and well-documented
- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow the linting and formatting rules once established

## Notes for Claude

- This is a fresh repository — infrastructure and tooling are not yet configured
- When adding new tooling, update this file to reflect build, test, and lint commands
- Always check for existing patterns before introducing new ones
